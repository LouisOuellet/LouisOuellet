## Hi there :wave:

I'm Louis Ouellet, welcome to my GitHub profile. From a very young age, I have been fascinated by computers. I built my first website at age 12 and the first book I bought was about Microsoft Office Access 2000. My knowledge and experience in programming come from a desire to learn the subject and experimenting since I was 12. I chose to study in network administration and security because I didn't have much knowledge of this aspect of computing and found the subject interesting to better my knowledge on the inner working of the internet as a whole.
